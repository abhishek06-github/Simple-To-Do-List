# Simple-To-Do-List
This is a simple to-do list web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The user can add tasks to the list and mark them as completed by clicking on them. The application also allows the user to delete tasks from the list. The interface is designed with a modern, minimalistic look and is easy to use.


This is a sample To-Do List project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

The HTML file contains the structure of the project and includes links to external stylesheets and JavaScript files. The CSS file is used to style the HTML elements, and the JavaScript file is used to add functionality to the project.

The project consists of a container with a form that allows the user to add tasks to a list. The form includes an input field and an "Add" button. When the user enters a task and clicks the "Add" button, the task is added to the list.

Each task in the list is represented by a div element that contains the name of the task and a delete button. The user can click the delete button to remove a task from the list. The user can also click on a task to mark it as completed, which is indicated by a strikethrough on the task name.

The project uses the Google Fonts API to load the Poppins font and the Font Awesome CDN to load the trash icon for the delete button.

The CSS file includes styles for the container, the form, the input field, the "Add" button, the list of tasks, and the individual tasks themselves. The CSS also includes styles for the completed tasks.

The JavaScript file includes an event listener for the "Add" button that checks if the input field is empty. If the input field is empty, the user is alerted to enter a task. If the input field is not empty, the task is added to the list, and event listeners are added to the delete button and the task div element to remove tasks and mark them as completed.
